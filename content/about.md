# Hi, I’m Alex

I’m a **technical writer and developer** who loves making complex things simple.  
My work spans from building **documentation sites** with Hugo/Astro to creating **clear diagrams** in Figma and Lucidchart.  

I focus on:
- Writing technical docs that actually help people
- Designing visuals that clarify architecture
- Building lightweight portfolio & docs sites with GitHub Pages

When I’m not documenting, you’ll probably find me learning a new dev tool or tweaking my portfolio.
